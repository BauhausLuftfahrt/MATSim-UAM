# UAM-Extension

This extension enhances MATSim (see the project's [Website](https://www.matsim.org) or [GitHub](https://github.com/matsim-org) pages) by allowing the definition and simulation of Urban Air Mobility infrastructure, vehicles, and operations. This extension is a collaborative development project between [Airbus Urban Mobility](https://www.airbus.com/innovation/urban-air-mobility.html), [Bauhaus Luftfahrt e.V.](https://www.bauhaus-luftfahrt.net), [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch), and [TU München](https://www.tse.bgu.tum.de) and authored by [Raoul Rothfeld](https://github.com/RRothfeld) and [Milos Balac](https://github.com/balacmi), with support from [Aitan Militão](https://github.com/Aitanm).

## Installation
Add the following to your maven pom.xml under `repositories`:
```xml
        <repository>
            <id>jitpack.io</id>
            <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
        </repository>
```
And the following to you maven pom.xml under `dependencies` for the latest version under active development:
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.BauhausLuftfahrt</groupId>
            <artifactId>MATSim-UAM</artifactId>
            <version>master-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
```
Older versions can be used by replacing the version text with any of the listed tags on [GitHub MATSim-UAM tags](https://github.com/BauhausLuftfahrt/MATSim-UAM/tags).

## Versions and Change Log

### v2.2 (untested, currently work-in-progress)
General:
- Update to MATSim v12
- Removal of ptSimulation config setting

### v2.1
General:
- Updated documentation for scenario creation and travel time scripts
- Refactoring (e.g. replacement of "landing stations" with "stations")
- Removal of unused code and marking others as deprecated

UAM vehicles types and stations:
- Vehicle types must now include maximum range (applied per leg)
- Removal of all landing and parking space capacity fragments (their inclusion would warant new implementation)
- **No backwards compatibility of input uam files.**

Dispatcher:
- Now separately stores available UAM vehicles based on vehicle type
- Requests remain being resolved in a queue but based on requested range and vehicle type (if the required ranged vehicle type is unavailable, the request is being deferred, other requests may still be resolved if a vehicle of their required type is available)

Station selection:
- Introduction of isStaticSearchRadius config parameter (default: true), if set to false, the search radius is not an absolut distance for possible UAM stations from any given location but is read as a percentage which is being applied to the beeline distance between origin and destination location.

Scenario creation:
- Rework of scenario creation with separation into beeline and routes scenario creator
- Simplification of input parameters for scenario creation via input config
- Integration of non-uam config to uam-enabled config conversion into scenario creation

### v2.0
Travel time scripts:
- Replaced provision of, e.g., network and transit schedule via programme arguments to retrieval from config file
- Added distance and links path list to CalculateCarTravelTimes
- Added distance and route information to CalculatePTTravelTimes

Updates the extension to MATSim version 11 and current DVRP version. Major changes includes:
- UAMQSimPlugin is substituted by UAMQSimModule
- A new fleet is provided every new iteration by using UAMFleetData

### v1.1
Input/output:
- UAM-enabled MATSim networks are required to provide an flight attribute indicating every flight links' flight segment (e.g. vertical or horizontal)
- **No backwards compatibility of input network files.**
- Included script for generating networkChangeEvents (files) from simulation results

Logging:
- Limited waiting time and failed UAM routing warnings to ten occurrences

### v1.0
- Publication of first open source MATSim-UAM version
